# 🏳️‍⚧️🛡️ TransShield — Submit Chaos, Protect Lives 🛡️🏳️‍⚧️

**TransShield** is a user script for [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), and works with most browsers.
This script works to generate and submit false reports on a **"certain health website"** to flood the system in defense of trans youth and their families.

> “In times of tyranny and injustice when law oppresses the people, the outlaw takes his place in history.” - Robin Hood

## 🚨 Why TransShield Exists

TransShield was created in response to the fascist takeover of the US government, more specifically the state sponsered 'report' forms targeting **innocent** trans youth and their families because they provide **life saving treatment and care** to their children. **Our mission is simple: flood these forms with false information until they're taken down.** By overwhelming the system, we make their job of finding what is real and fake almost impossible, and thus protects the ones that require protection the most.

### 🤖 Captcha Bypass - Automation Feature 
- While not perfect, a bypass for the captcha has now been implemented

- There is currently no way to bypass these security mesures without a bypass service though, researching is ongoing.

## ⚠️ FOR YOUR SAFETY, PLEASE USE A **VPN**!

To protect your identity while using TransShield, **always** use a VPN:

- 🔒 [**MullvadVPN**](https://mullvad.net/) [Paid: $5/month]
- 🔒 [**ProtonVPN**](https://protonvpn.com/) [Free / Paid: $9.99/month]
- 🔒 [**IVPN**](https://www.ivpn.net) [Paid - $6/month]
- 🔐 [**Windscribe**](https://windscribe.com) [Free / Paid: $9/month]

🔒 = **No logs, and audited**.

🔐 = **Some logs, *not* audited**.

It is also **highly recommended** that you use a secure browser with anti-fingerprinting and other security features like [Mullvad Browser](https://mullvad.net/en/browser) which is free and made in collboration with the TOR Project. Using both a VPN and Mullvad Browser together is a strong and secure combo as a VPN is not enough for security as you can be indentified through other means. You can use a site called [CoverYourTracks](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/) by the Electronic Frontier Foundation to see what types of personal info your browser / device is leaking.
